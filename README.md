# Flip a coin

Experimental Toy App. A coin is flipped every second and the results 
are tracked using a series of  variables stored in cookies. 

All counters are per-user and are reset when the 
browser session is closed.

Just an exercise on learning Ruby on Rails. Made on Rails 5.0.1, 
but it doesn't have serious dependencies or use a DB at all, so it should
run on almost any rails version.
